# Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (CNN-VAE)

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our CNN-VAE model. This repository contains the implementation of a Convolutional Variational Autoencoder, a generative deep learning model used for learning latent representations, particularly effective in image data processing.

## Description

A Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (CNN-VAE) is a type of generative model that leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) within the VAE architecture. This implementation focuses on efficiently handling image data, allowing for effective learning of latent representations in an unsupervised manner.

## Features

- Convolutional Neural Network for image data encoding and decoding.
- Variational inference techniques for latent space generation.
- Implementation using TensorFlow and Keras for ease of use and flexibility.
- Customizable architecture to fit various types of image data.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:
- Python 3.7 or later
- TensorFlow 2.0 or later
- NumPy

Install the required packages using pip:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy

## Getting Started
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Riffe007/cnn-vae-2.git
cd cnn-vae-2

Initialize and Train the Model

Import the ConvVAE class from the script.
Instantiate and train the model with your data.
python
Copy code
from conv_vae import ConvVAE

vae = ConvVAE()
# Assume 'data' is your dataset
vae.train(data)


Model Interaction

Save and load model weights for reusability.
python
Copy code
vae.save_weights('path_to_save_weights')
vae.load_weights('path_to_load_weights')

## Customizing the Model
Modify the parameters within the ConvVAE class to fit the specific requirements of your image dataset, such as adjusting the number of convolutional filters or kernel sizes.
